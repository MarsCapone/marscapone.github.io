Not even a week has past and this evening we went to the next show. This time Kyoto at sohoplace - the new theatre in the West End. 

This play is not fiction, it's modern history. A dramatization of the 1997 UN climate conference in Kyoto, which saw the signing of the first legally binding climate treaty.

Closing thoughts of the first act:

> This is a damning representation of the USA, that does no favours in improving my view of it. 
>
> *(hint: this view did not change in the second act)*

Despite being about legal proceedings over scientific matters, the play is not at all dry. It's word heavy, but still dynamic. It's accessible without dumbing down the content. Delegates argue over specific words, meanings, even punctuation. With the bureaucracy we witness in local government, it's not hard to believe this is how it actually happened. 

The events of the play are various UN conferences culminating in the signing of the "Kyoto Protocol" in December 1997. Meanwhile an unlikely narrator, Don Pearlman, oil lobbyist, explains every meeting and conference, and meddles in every discussion to represent the interests of the global petroleum companies. 

In a world of fake news and alternative facts, the anti-science rhetoric and political subterfuge made me feel slightly sick. Pearlman sees his role as to run the discussions into the ground, to prevent any agreement from being made. There's a six step strategy for this:

1. Be present in every second of the negotiations
2. Challenge the science
3. Double diplomacy. Say one thing to one country - and something completely different to another country
4. Emphasise the cost of action
5. Influence domestic politics
6. Characted assassination

Although the conference ends with agreement, and Pearlman being ignored, it's a hollow victory for the world. There is no sense that the delegate for the USA understands the meaning of the word compromise, and there are US representatives actively denying science and trampling on other countries. It's kind of frustrating to watch. 

I'm going to try not go on an anti-US rant right now, but this seems very similar to the USA of today. Lobbyists control the government (or even have seats in the government), a climate denier leads the country, and scarcely keep his train of thought between three words, let alone conversations between countries.

> _Don_: It’s time to stop messing around. It’s time to burn it down. All of it. No prisoners. No mercy. Scorched fucking earth. Strategy Six. Character Assassination. If you can’t kill the science, kill the scientist.

And today we have (just one of many occasions) a different Don inciting death threats against a New York judge, and a coup against the government, and activiely dismantling the lives of normal people. 

The USA is not portrayed in a good light in this play, and it just seems like the inception of a lot of the problems of today - where big companies got together and decided how they were going to fuck the world for everyone else. 

It was a good production and I enjoyed it. I only wish I could be watching it 100+ years from now. Either everything predicted has come to pass and people will look back on this as the beginning of the end, or countries will have come together to fix the problems, and the Trumps of the world will say "clearly it wasn't a problem, so why did everyone complain about it". 

Unfortunately my expectation is the former.
