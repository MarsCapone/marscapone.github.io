When I started this website, it was merely out of regret that I hadn't dedicated any time to my previous website, and the want to claim this domain ([samson.is-a.dev](https://samson.is-a.dev)). 

But a website with just an [About](/about) section is boring. And I like writing. I write letters (by hand) to penpals, family, friends. I like writing blog posts at work. So why shouldn't I write blog posts in my personal life?

For those other things, I can always find a topic. At work I write about problems or solutions or successes. With my penpals, we share updates of our lives. But what should I write about on a personal blog?

I don't know the answer. But given I enjoy writing, I'm resolving to try to find some topics. On [The Medium](https://medium.com), I am always being recommended posts that have zero value. So if other people can do it, why not me too?

> [!IDEA] What do I know about?
> * Cooking
> * Letter writing
> * Scrabble
> * Software

These seem like reasonable topics to get started with.

_By posting this I'm already one post ahead on the website I started three years ago!_
